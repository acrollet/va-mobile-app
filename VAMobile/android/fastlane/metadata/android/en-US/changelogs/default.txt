We updated the sections of the app to Home, Benefits, Health, and Payments.

Home shows your name and branch of service. It also includes links for how to contact us and find VA locations.
Benefits includes your disability rating, claims and appeals, and VA letters.
Health includes your VA prescriptions, health care appointments, secure messages, and vaccine records.
Payments includes your VA payments history and direct deposit information.

We also moved Profile to the Home section.
