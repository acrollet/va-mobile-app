# Design librarian

## Overview

* **What is a design librarian?** Design librarians are a rotating designer who maintains and improves how we work in Figma and serves as a resource within the mobile team, VA, and Ad Hoc. There are two design librarians — one serves on the Design System team and the other serves on the Flagship app team.
* **How long does a design librarian serve?** Design librarians serve for a full quarter. During the first month, they shadow the previous librarian. During the second month, they work independently. And during the third month, they onboard the next librarian. More information about onboarding and offboarding permissions in Figma can be found on the [doc site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/How-We-Work/figma-permissions).
* **How much time is expected per week?** Design librarians are expected to spend less than 4 hours per week, but this can fluctuate depending on their current workload.
