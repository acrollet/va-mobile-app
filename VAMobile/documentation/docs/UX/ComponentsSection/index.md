title: Components

The VA Mobile app is designed using components to help to ensure consistency in look, feel and interaction across the app's features. Each component description includes guidelines for use, examples and resources (UX and ENG).

Components for use in mockups can be found in the [VA Mobile app Design Library](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/VAMobile-DesignLibrary1.0-%F0%9F%93%90?node-id=501%3A40&t=P62TR9FmT9E6a4O2-1). Proposed new components are reviewed by the cross-functional component committee before being added to the Design Library and codebase. Learn more about the [process for adding/updating components to the library](/docs/UX/How-We-Work/design-librarian/).
