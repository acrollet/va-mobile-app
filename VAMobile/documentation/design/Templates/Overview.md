Templates, or page layouts, compose components within a single page. A layout can contain multiple variations of a component depending on the context and may include display logic. Templates help to ensure consistent behavior across the VA mobile app's features. 

The following templates are used in the VA mobile app:
- [Navigation model](/design/Templates/NavigationModel)
- [Screen types](/design/Templates/ScreenTypes)
