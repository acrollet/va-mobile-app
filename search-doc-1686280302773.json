"},{"title":"Inclusive meeting best practices:​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Team norms","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/About our team/team-norms#inclusive-meeting-best-practices","content":"Try to share the meeting agenda and materials ahead of time. This allows folks to come to the meeting prepared with questions, review them async if that is more comfortable, or follow along if they can’t attend a meeting. Also it’s helpful to add timecodes when creating meeting invites.Turn on live captioning for every call. Live captioning services are a critical way for some individuals to understand and participate in meetings. Connect your speech and visuals. Try to connect the subject of your talk to the presentation or on-screen visuals. This helps folk understand who might not be able to see on-screen. If folks are using captions remember that during screen share it means they might immediately see or be reading the captions in real-time. Be mindful of the clock. If you are leading a meeting try to time box agenda items so that everyone gets what they need and expect out of the meeting. If you are participating in a meeting try to keep discussion focused to the agenda so the team can try to work through all the items.Use the raise hand feature in meetings. It helps give everyone a chance to take a turn, and helps facilitators moderate discussions. This also will help people using accessibility tools who may otherwise miss verbal or visual cues. Stay on mute until it is your turn to talk. Interruption and interjections can make live captioning difficult. For people using live captioning (or transcription) services, even innocuous interjections, affirmations, and “hmms” can make it difficult to follow the transcript. Unless called on directly, take turns making space to let other folks speak or answer a question. Helps everyone get a chance to speak in meetings and get experience presenting ideas.Cameras encouraged but optional. Zoom fatigue, anxiety, ADHD, chaotic children or pets, and other life things can make turning your camera on a negative experience. In large group meetings try to turn your camera on during the first 2-3 minutes to say hello. Or try turning it on for small group meetings and/or one-on-ones. It’s nice to see folks' faces, but we’ll leave the choice to be on camera up to you.Consider which chat method would work best for your meeting. For some folks, especially those who might be using assistive technology, discussions in the meeting chat software can be distracting or confusing to follow. Also the discussion often will be lost once the meeting ends which means folks not in attendance could miss out. One option is to capture those comments and conversations in Slack or in an asynchronous document used for the meeting. Other caption specific pro-tips we’ve learned:​ Turn on captions for yourself and follow them to make sure what you are saying is translating correctly. For example, some names don’t translate well so you may need to also say folk’s title (e.g. “Let’s check with the product manager on that feature”). Captioning software can struggle if folks talk too fast. It will attempt to autocorrect words as it goes, but keep in mind that you might have to talk a bit slower so it can translate correctly. Captions can be a second or more behind so folks may need time to catch up. Google Meet: You don’t need to do anything to enable captions on Google Meet.Zoom: If you are hosting Zoom meetings here is info on how to enable auto captioning.

In some cases, a single request from the client can require data from multiple external services. This can cause those requests to be slow and creates a bad user experience. To mitigate the issue, we use the Parallel Gem, which provides a simple interface for executing functions in parallel using threads. A simple use pattern is: Find the common location where code branches off into the multiple network calls.Wrap the methods that initiate those branches in lambdas.Pass an array of those lambdas to the gem, telling it how many threads to use and specifying that it should execute the call method on each lambda to execute it.Capture return values if needed.It is possible to rescue errors either within lambdas or around the entire parallelization code block. This allows us the ability to capture errors and either log them or provide helpful information back to the client. If we do not rescue, errors will stop execution and be handled as they normally would.","keywords":""},{"title":"Record Filtering","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/RecordFiltering","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Record Filtering","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/RecordFiltering#overview","content":"The vets-api has a mechanism built into the Common::Collection class that's intended to be used to filter lists of records. However, there are a number of problems with this, including the fact that many of the services we use to fetch indexes do not return data in collections and instead just use arrays. Additionally, the filtering mechanism requires changes to the filtered model to enable filtering and to define the type of filtering allowed. There are also some limits to the collection's filtering logic that have prevented this library from meeting our requirements. And since both Common::Collection and many of the models we use exist outside of the mobile module, they're not easy for us to change. To address these limitations, we've created our own filtering library that borrows the same param syntax from Common::Collection but removes the requirement to make changes to the model. This will allow us to easily apply filters to all of our indexes and make changes to the filtering logic as needed without the risk of impacting other teams.

"},{"title":"Frontend​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Record Filtering","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/RecordFiltering#frontend","content":"The front end must provide filters as query params in the format filter[model_attribute][operation]=value. For example, if your model implements an attribute called &quot;status&quot; and you want to receive only records where the status equals &quot;complete&quot;, you would add the param filter[status][eq]=complete. At this time, our filtering system only supports two operations: eq and not_eq. Attribute/operation pairs can only be used once. In other words, you can't request filter[status][eq]=complete and filter[status][eq]=pending. This is a limitation in how params are processed by the rails app. We intend to add &quot;one of these values&quot; functionality as well as other operations later. Filters are additive.

"},{"title":"Back-end​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Maintenance Windows","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Features/MaintenanceWindows#back-end","content":"Unlike most of the data used in the vets-api engine, MaintenanceWindows come from the vets-api database and not from upstream servers. They're added there by developers on other teams. They contain the external service name, start time, and end time. The mobile app requests maintenance windows via the maintenance windows controller, which searches the database for MaintenanceWindow records that end in the future and creates a ServiceGraph object to process those windows into a format that is more easily used by the front-end. The ServiceGraph is an abstraction that accepts a list of arguments that define a hierarchy that matches upstream services to downstream features and returns a list of upcoming Mobile::MaintenanceWindow records that have upcoming outages. Note that Mobile::MaintenanceWindows are different than MaintenanceWindows but contain the same basic data with service names that are specific to mobile app features. This allows the mobile team to define its own mapping of services to features. Each argument is an array of two symbols in which the first element is an upstream service or intermediate service and the second key is either an intermediate service or the feature name that would be received by the mobile app. Intermediate services are not included in the results, only terminal nodes (i.e., second items in the array that do not match the first items of any subsequent arrays). An example ServiceGraph instance could be something like: Mobile::V0::ServiceGraph.new( %i[bgs evss], %i[vet360 military_service_history], %i[evss claims], %i[evss direct_deposit_benefits] ) Copy This gets processed into a hierarchy like: { bgs: [claims, direct_deposit_benefits], evss: [claims, direct_deposit_benefits], vet360: [military_service_history] } Copy So if there's an upcoming maintenance window for either bgs or evss, the ServiceGraph would return an array of Mobile::MaintenanceWindow objects including start and end times for claims and direct_deposit_benefits. If there's an upcoming maintenance window for vet360, it would return mobile maintenance window data for military_service_history. And if all three services had upcoming maintenance windows, it would return data for claims, direct_deposit_benefits, and military_service_history.

It's also the first place to look for latency issues and to check if an upstream service is down.Datadog's Application Performance Management tool is also configured for vets-api. It breaks down the ruby, database, and upstream calls down so you can determine the source latency. The APM also provides p50 and p99 latency data to let us know how slow the worst 50% and 1% of calls are doing. If you've determined that the source of the issue is an upstream service contact the relevant party.If you believe a forward proxy is down or having trouble connecting to the service. Then contact the Operations team via DSVA Slack's #vfs-platform-support channel. To open a support ticket type /support. This will open a modal window with a form rather than posting a Slack message. For the 'I need help from' field select 'Operations Team'. Then add the details in the 'Summary of request' field.Finally if the error is not from the API, a forward proxy connection to an upstream service, or an upstream service itself but rather an issue with infrastructure that we (and VSP/VFS) control then a SNOW ticket should be opened.

All our classes are namespaced with a 'Mobile' Ruby module. When auditing errors a custom search of 'Mobile' filters out other vets-api errors. To further refine the search to only 'error', rather than 'warn' or 'info' level errors you can toggle open the search builder bar. And then select 'error' from the list. Once you've found an error, or have been linked to one directly from an alert email, you'll be taken to the error details page. The majority of our errors occur during HTTP responses. Often the errors first present themselves deep within the API framework's base classes. Selecting the 'Full' tab reveals the full call stack and as seen below the true source of the error. Once the location of the error has been determined the next step is determining the cause. Errors from bugs we have introduced (500s in our API responses) will have clear Ruby errors such as 'NoMethodError'. For errors from sub-systems you'll need to check the 'ADDITIONAL DATA' section of the error details page. As seen below this section includes the errors from the upstream service as well as any custom tags added for that specific service.

A GitHub Action runs every Tuesday morning to check and see if there is a staged build ready for developer release in the Apple App Store. For Play Store, it checks to see if there is a newer build than the production lane waiting in the Pre-Prod Stash lane. If there is, they are released to production at that time and sends a message to the main va-mobile-app channel in DSVA slack. If not, it completes silently. Release branches are cut by an Action every other Wednesday that follows a release. The release branch acts as a freeze on the develop branch for the next release that allows QA to run regressions from a static point and allows any last-minute changes to be added before being merged to main and build for review in the stores. This release branch being created then starts automation that creates the release ticket in GitHub and assigns the relevant people. Releases coincide with the last day of a sprint and new release branches are cut on the first day of the sprint. Release process approval ends with an authorized person (currently a VA Product Owner) releasing the app for build and upload to the stores by running the /approve command in the automated release ticket. This is accomplish by adding a comment to the issue in the form of /approve vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z is the next version number. This version number should be present in the title of the ticket. Once the release is approved, the build system will create and upload production versions of the app to the App Stores for review. Barring any issues, these should be released on the next Tuesday when the release Action runs. NOTE: Because chrontab notation doesn't have a way to schedule a job at an interval , i.e. every two weeks, the release action has to be scheduled for EVERY Tuesday. This means that if the approve command is run before the Tuesday in the middle of the sprint, the releases will go out a week early.​ "},{"title":"QA Builds​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Build automation overview","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/DevOps/Overview#qa-builds","content":""},{"title":"Daily Builds​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Build automation overview","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/DevOps/Overview#daily-builds","content":"Regular QA builds are distributed every weekday.

The front-end checks for active downtime windows once per session during the sync stage after login and caches the data for the remainder of the session. Downtime messages use the same display pattern as errors in code, with additional checks in the useError utility to check if a downtime error exists for a specific screen ID. Multiple features can trigger a downtime message on a single screen, e.g. claims and appeals are two separate features but display on the same page. Whether a downtime message is displayed if a subset of features on the screen are down is a business decision that varies based on feature.

Often we can overlook the downstream effects of our work in order to complete our tasks in a defined timeline. We should take the time to consider how taking the easy or fastest route can complicate our team’s work in the future. Our team strives to create fast, good code that deploys to high-uptime applications and services. We work to make the codebase better every time we touch it and to make the final product better as a result.

Engineering is the implementation of a product, which means that there are higher levels of consideration that we need to be aware of and practice. Engineers should always take the time to think about where their work sits within the system of things and not as if it exists in a vacuum. Second-order thinking involves solving problems and asking ourselves “What is next?” Thinking about how our changes and work interact with the larger work is paramount to building good software and not making mistakes that we could have prevented. When removing something, we should first know why it was there in the first place in order to understand its reason for being there. Only after we understand this context can we be sure that removing it won’t cause more harm than good. Chesterton’s Fence is the most common metaphor for this, but any quick search about second order thinking provides a wealth of information if you would like to improve your ability to think in this way.

This not only assumes that time will be allocated immediately to address this, but it also assumes that technical debt of this kind is value-neutral. Technical debt that is purposely accrued because you believe it can be addressed later is still technical debt. We should not accrue this debt without careful consideration, and getting work out the door is not a valid reason to accrue such debt. We should work to make sure we address the small issues and fix those inaccuracies the first time, rather than expect a teammate to come by later and clean up the debt we are creating in our code.

There are few things worse than looking at something complicated with no or almost no documentation. I have personally gone back to work from many years ago, not realizing it was mine and became extremely irritated with the code; it was not documented at all and was extremely abstract.

When we create or update reusable components and utilities, we should be pushing that work on to develop first, then pulling those changes back into the branch we are using. This is an extension of the rule about work being as atomic as possible. If we are building a thing that everyone will use, we should add it to the code base by itself then add it to our branch and build the specific use.

The flip side is that our logic may be flawed and that someone else can help us correct that logic in order to find new ways for us to think. Good engineers know why they are doing something.

A plan is only as good as our ability to estimate the amount of work we can accomplish in a time period. Not accomplishing tasks because we didn’t estimate correctly, or we had “hidden” work that took up our time has downstream effects on our team’s ability to make commitments to deliver. We should make sure that we are taking credit for all of our work by insisting that we always have a ticket for anything that we are doing, including discovery work. Whether it’s coding a screen, a spike for feasibility, or just googling for possible libraries we should be accounting for this work. This protects us by showing how much work we are actually doing that may not have an obvious delivery purpose. It also makes sure that we have accurate target dates for the whole project and can show progress when there may not be explicit code to point to.

When this is not the case, we should make sure that the tickets are explicit about what the output is and that we create and document the correct output. Sometimes this will be a documentation page. Sometimes this might be a writeup of our discovery or spike findings and our proposed solution. A strong engineering team is capable of many things beyond coding and we should be creating artifacts that showcase our work on non-code problems.

The inverse of this is that we should trust that after we provide feedback that the other teams are evaluating our feedback and using it to inform their decisions.

Remember that identifying the problem is only the beginning, we also need to have a plan on how to overcome the issue. Learning to create proposals and plans for implementing solutions is a very important skill for engineers as they progress in their careers, and we should be practicing those skills whenever we have the chance. We gain skills for thinking about a project above the code, we learn creative ways to solve problems and learn how to give and receive feedback from others, and then learn to incorporate that feedback into our own work to become better engineers and teammates. The idea of a player-led team starts with empowering the players to make suggestions and to learn from feedback in a safe space. While this is not a promise to implement all solutions that are offered up–sometimes ideas may not work for the project or for the context or may just not work yet. We promise to review all of the ideas and to communicate the why or why not so that we all can understand the context.

The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews). style\tStyleProp&lt;ViewStyle&gt; No testID\tstring No\tUsed to locate this view in end-to-end tests. Optional TestID nativeID\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. collapsable\tboolean No\tViews that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy. needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing\tboolean No\tWhether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background). Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\tboolean No\tWhether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU. On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. focusable\tboolean No\tWhether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. shouldRasterizeIOS\tboolean No\tWhether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing. On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame. Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property. isTVSelectable\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable and navigable using the Apple TV remote. @platform ios hasTVPreferredFocus\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view. @platform ios tvParallaxProperties\tTVParallaxProperties No\t*(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceX\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceY\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxTiltAngle\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 0.05. @platform ios tvParallaxMagnification\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 1.0. @platform ios onStartShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tDoes this view want to become responder on the start of a touch? onMoveShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tCalled for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to &quot;claim&quot; touch responsiveness? onResponderEnd\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tIf the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen: onResponderGrant\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening onResponderReject\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tSomething else is the responder right now and will not release it onResponderMove\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe user is moving their finger onResponderRelease\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tFired at the end of the touch, ie &quot;touchUp&quot; onResponderStart\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No onResponderTerminationRequest\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tSomething else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release onResponderTerminate\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) onStartShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.

If a Touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}} NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views. id\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. onLayout\t(event: LayoutChangeEvent) =&gt; void No\tInvoked on mount and layout changes with {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}. pointerEvents\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;box-none&quot; | &quot;box-only&quot; | &quot;auto&quot; No\tIn the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class: .box-none { pointer-events: none; } .box-none * { pointer-events: all; } box-only is the equivalent of .box-only { pointer-events: all; } .box-only * { pointer-events: none; } But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform. removeClippedSubviews\tboolean No\tThis is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews). style\tStyleProp&lt;ViewStyle&gt; No testID\tstring No\tUsed to locate this view in end-to-end tests. Optional TestID nativeID\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. collapsable\tboolean No\tViews that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy. needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing\tboolean No\tWhether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background). Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\tboolean No\tWhether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU. On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. focusable\tboolean No\tWhether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. shouldRasterizeIOS\tboolean No\tWhether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing. On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame. Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property. isTVSelectable\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable and navigable using the Apple TV remote. @platform ios hasTVPreferredFocus\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view. @platform ios tvParallaxProperties\tTVParallaxProperties No\t*(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceX\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) onStartShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first.

This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=&quot;fast&quot;`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` prop. snapToOffsets\tnumber[] No\tWhen set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=&quot;fast&quot;`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props. snapToStart\tboolean No\tUse in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true. snapToEnd\tboolean No\tUse in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true. stickyHeaderIndices\tnumber[] No\tAn array of child indices determining which children get docked to the top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. disableIntervalMomentum\tboolean No\tWhen true, the scroll view stops on the next index (in relation to scroll position at release) regardless of how fast the gesture is. This can be used for horizontal pagination when the page is less than the width of the ScrollView. The default value is false. disableScrollViewPanResponder\tboolean No\tWhen true, the default JS pan responder on the ScrollView is disabled, and full control over touches inside the ScrollView is left to its child components. This is particularly useful if `snapToInterval` is enabled, since it does not follow typical touch patterns. Do not use this on regular ScrollView use cases without `snapToInterval` as it may cause unexpected touches to occur while scrolling. The default value is false. StickyHeaderComponent\tComponentType&lt;any&gt; No\tA React Component that will be used to render sticky headers, should be used together with stickyHeaderIndices. You may need to set this component if your sticky header uses custom transforms, for example, when you want your list to have an animated and hidable header. If component have not been provided, the default ScrollViewStickyHeader component will be used. hitSlop\tInsets No\tThis defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}} NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views. id\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. onLayout\t(event: LayoutChangeEvent) =&gt; void No\tInvoked on mount and layout changes with {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}. pointerEvents\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;box-none&quot; | &quot;box-only&quot; | &quot;auto&quot; No\tIn the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class: .box-none { pointer-events: none; } .box-none * { pointer-events: all; } box-only is the equivalent of .box-only { pointer-events: all; } .box-only * { pointer-events: none; } But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform. testID\tstring No\tUsed to locate this view in end-to-end tests. nativeID\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. collapsable\tboolean No\tViews that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy. needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing\tboolean No\tWhether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background). Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\tboolean No\tWhether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU. On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. focusable\tboolean No\tWhether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. shouldRasterizeIOS\tboolean No\tWhether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing. On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame. Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property. isTVSelectable\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable and navigable using the Apple TV remote. @platform ios hasTVPreferredFocus\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view. @platform ios tvParallaxProperties\tTVParallaxProperties No\t*(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceX\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceY\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxTiltAngle\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 0.05. @platform ios tvParallaxMagnification\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 1.0. @platform ios onStartShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tDoes this view want to become responder on the start of a touch? onMoveShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tCalled for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to &quot;claim&quot; touch responsiveness? onResponderEnd\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tIf the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen: onResponderGrant\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening onResponderReject\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tSomething else is the responder right now and will not release it onResponderMove\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe user is moving their finger onResponderRelease\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tFired at the end of the touch, ie &quot;touchUp&quot; onResponderStart\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No onResponderTerminationRequest\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tSomething else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release onResponderTerminate\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) onStartShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.

By default, the label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space. aria-label\tstring No\tAlias for accessibilityLabel https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#accessibilitylabel https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/34424 accessibilityRole\tAccessibilityRole No\tAccessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on. accessibilityState\tAccessibilityState No\tAccessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on. aria-busy\tboolean No\talias for accessibilityState see https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitystate aria-checked\tboolean | &quot;mixed&quot; No aria-disabled\tboolean No aria-expanded\tboolean No aria-selected\tboolean No aria-labelledby\tstring No\tRepresents the nativeID of the associated label text. When the assistive technology focuses on the component with this props, the text is read aloud. @platform android accessibilityHint\tstring No\tAn accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label. accessibilityValue\tAccessibilityValue No\tRepresents the current value of a component. It can be a textual description of a component's value, or for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars, it contains range information (minimum, current, and maximum). aria-valuemax\tnumber No aria-valuemin\tnumber No aria-valuenow\tnumber No aria-valuetext\tstring No onAccessibilityAction\t(event: AccessibilityActionEvent) =&gt; void No\tWhen `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs an accessibility custom action. importantForAccessibility\t&quot;auto&quot; | &quot;yes&quot; | &quot;no&quot; | &quot;no-hide-descendants&quot; No\t[Android] Controlling if a view fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services. aria-hidden\tboolean No\tA value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden. aria-live\t&quot;polite&quot; | &quot;assertive&quot; | &quot;off&quot; No aria-modal\tboolean No role\tRole No\tIndicates to accessibility services to treat UI component like a specific role. accessibilityLiveRegion\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;polite&quot; | &quot;assertive&quot; No\tIndicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.

The provided string value must follow the BCP 47 specification (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylanguage-ios @platform ios alwaysBounceHorizontal\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise. alwaysBounceVertical\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise. automaticallyAdjustContentInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar. The default value is true. automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether the ScrollView should automatically adjust its contentInset and scrollViewInsets when the Keyboard changes its size. The default value is false. automaticallyAdjustsScrollIndicatorInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether iOS should automatically adjust the scroll indicator insets. The default value is true. Available on iOS 13 and later. bounces\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true. bouncesZoom\tboolean No\tWhen true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed the limits. canCancelContentTouches\tboolean No\tWhen false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves. The default value is true. centerContent\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default value is false. contentInset\tInsets No\tThe amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view. Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}. contentOffset\tPointProp No\tUsed to manually set the starting scroll offset. The default value is {x: 0, y: 0} contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior\t&quot;always&quot; | &quot;never&quot; | &quot;automatic&quot; | &quot;scrollableAxes&quot; No\tThis property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view. The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51. directionalLockEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal scrolling while dragging. The default value is false. indicatorStyle\t&quot;default&quot; | &quot;black&quot; | &quot;white&quot; No\tThe style of the scroll indicators. - default (the default), same as black. - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against a white content background. - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against a black content background. maintainVisibleContentPosition\t{ autoscrollToTopThreshold?: number; minIndexForVisible: number; } No\tWhen set, the scroll view will adjust the scroll position so that the first child that is currently visible and at or beyond minIndexForVisible will not change position. This is useful for lists that are loading content in both directions, e.g. a chat thread, where new messages coming in might otherwise cause the scroll position to jump. A value of 0 is common, but other values such as 1 can be used to skip loading spinners or other content that should not maintain position. The optional autoscrollToTopThreshold can be used to make the content automatically scroll to the top after making the adjustment if the user was within the threshold of the top before the adjustment was made. This is also useful for chat-like applications where you want to see new messages scroll into place, but not if the user has scrolled up a ways and it would be disruptive to scroll a bunch. Caveat 1: Reordering elements in the scrollview with this enabled will probably cause jumpiness and jank. It can be fixed, but there are currently no plans to do so. For now, don't re-order the content of any ScrollViews or Lists that use this feature. Caveat 2: This uses contentOffset and frame.origin in native code to compute visibility. Occlusion, transforms, and other complexity won't be taken into account as to whether content is &quot;visible&quot; or not. maximumZoomScale\tnumber No\tThe maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0. minimumZoomScale\tnumber No\tThe minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0. onScrollAnimationEnd\t() =&gt; void No\tCalled when a scrolling animation ends. pinchGestureEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out. The default value is true. scrollEventThrottle\tnumber No\tThis controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (as a time interval in ms). A lower number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position, but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being sent over the bridge. The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled. scrollIndicatorInsets\tInsets No\tThe amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view. This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset. Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}. scrollToOverflowEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true, the scroll view can be programmatically scrolled beyond its content size. The default value is false. @platform ios scrollsToTop\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped. The default value is true. snapToAlignment\t&quot;center&quot; | &quot;start&quot; | &quot;end&quot; No\tWhen `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the snapping to the scroll view. - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical) - `center` will align the snap in the center - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical) onScrollToTop\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires when the scroll view scrolls to top after the status bar has been tapped @platform ios zoomScale\tnumber No\tThe current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0. endFillColor\tColorValue No\tSometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills. When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not needed in the general case. scrollPerfTag\tstring No\tTag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native FpsListener for it to be useful. @platform android overScrollMode\t&quot;auto&quot; | &quot;always&quot; | &quot;never&quot; No\tUsed to override default value of overScroll mode. Possible values: - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll. - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view. - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view. nestedScrollEnabled\tboolean No\tEnables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS. fadingEdgeLength\tnumber No\tFades out the edges of the scroll content. If the value is greater than 0, the fading edges will be set accordingly to the current scroll direction and position, indicating if there is more content to show. The default value is 0. @platform android persistentScrollbar\tboolean No\tCauses the scrollbars not to turn transparent when they are not in use. The default value is false.","keywords":""},{"title":"Content","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/Foundations/Content","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Voice and tone​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Content","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/Foundations/Content#voice-and-tone","content":"We follow the VA design system content principles.

Examples of this are displaying global navigation on every screen in the hierarchy, screen names that are unique and descriptive, using common screen transitions to communicate a screen's position in the hierarchy, and including descriptive back labels on each screen.Delivers value at every level: Each screen in the app should contain valuable and/or actionable content—no screens that are just lists of links. Extensible: The app’s IA and navigation model leave room to expand its feature set by considering and anticipating future organizational needs.Informed by Veterans: IA decisions are based on user research conducted with Veterans, examining their mental models around the organization of common tasks and undertanding of labels, as well as getting feedback on proposed solutions. Keeps it simple: Content is prioiritized and includes only what’s absolutely necessary—the fewer elements (number of levels in the hierarchy, number of screens, number of links on a screen) the better.

Determining Navigation and Information Architecture Placement for New VA Mobile App Features is a guide intended to help teams decide where a new feature belongs in this app’s sitemap and navigation model. Always try to find a placement in an existing category first before proposing a new top-level category for a feature. Confirm new category names and contents with card sort research before adding to the app.Within a category, keep the hierarchy as flat as possible in terms of screens (limit the levels it’s possible to drill down through in order to get to child screens), but without inlcuding too many options on a single screen. If there are many features within a category, group the features and label the groups at category level before introducing additional levels into the screen hierarchy—this helps avoid cognitive overload.All features in the VA mobile app should have a primary placement within the app’s taxonomy, even if there are multiple entry points for it at different locations within the app (example of secondary entry points: personalized home screen content, cross-references within other sections).When content outgrows the current category structure, conduct card sort research to determine new category names and contents (Avoid using “hamburger” and “more” menus as primary navigation).

Typography All text styles should be pulled from the Design Tokens file (not light/dark theme files). Autolayout Components must be set up to automatically vertically resize as text changes. Typically, a component’s height will need to be set to “hug” to accomplish this. Components must be set up for responsive widths. Here are some potential ways to achieve this: Variant widths may need to be set to “fill” at 360px.Constraints may need to be set to &quot;left and right&quot; or “scale.”Autolayout properties may need to be customized depending on the component’s design.

Content designer leads content work: The content designer is heavily involved in features or projects that are complex, have a large scope, or require extensive collaboration between VA stakeholders, including Sitewide Content team. The content designer should be included in all meetings (stakeholder, engineering, product, etc.). For these types of projects, the content designer is already aware of complexity, scope, and requirements as they will be involved in leadership-level meetings in which upcoming work is discussed by POs, PMs, and delivery leads.Content designer completes discovery work (either in direct collaboration with or separate from UX designer), which could include the following tasks: Completing a content-focused comparative analysis (if needed)Identifying copy to be repurposed from VA.gov or other VA productsReviewing relevant VA content briefs (if available)Reviewing prior research results Content designer and UX designer directly collaborate on low-fidelity wireframes and user flowsIf research is within scope, content designer works with UX designer and researcher to ensure research plans encompass copy-related questions and also to ensure conversation guides are accurately wordedContent designer and UX designer continue to work closely on changes to designs, iterations, and edge cases.Copy is delivered directly in Figma design files. Content designer and UX designer can use copy status tags in Figma to note where copy is in the process (i.e., copy needs approval, copy in progress, copy ready, etc.). Content designer owns final sign-off on copy and will likely pass copy through the Sitewide Content team for approval given the complexity of the project. Content designer supports content work: The content designer takes a supportive role for less or smaller projects. Examples include features in which we can easily pull content from VA.gov or smaller projects. Content designer doesn’t need to be included in all meetings. Content designer meets with UX designer and product manager to understand problem space, possible solutions, and technical constraints. Content designer raises possible risks or issues that might affect the copy.UX designer completes content-specific discovery tasks. This may include completing a comparative analysis, reviewing VA style guide/plain language standards, accessing VA content briefs, etc.UX designer meets with content designer to review first pass at copy.
